Mechanics (Unique Mechanics from Class Game):

- Player is only able to move LEFT and RIGHT

- Aliens speed ranges from 5 to 10, each alien having a random speed
- Player is able to shoot aliens with laserbeams
- Every alien shot by a player causes the player to gain 1 point
- Every alien that passes the player and gets to Earth, causes the player to lose 1 point
- Aliens spawn off screen to give the effect that they are coming from somewhere and they are deleted off screen after they pass the human (I kept the limit of Aliens to 10 because sometimes too many was too hard)
- Bullets dissappear after hitting an alien (it was too easy when bullets killed multiple)
- Score is displayed at the top of the screen, also added new textures, as well as a background
